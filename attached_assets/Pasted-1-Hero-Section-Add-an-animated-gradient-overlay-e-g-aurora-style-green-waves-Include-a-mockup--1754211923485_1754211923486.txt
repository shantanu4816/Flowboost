1. Hero Section
Add an animated gradient overlay (e.g. auroraâ€‘style green waves).

Include a mockup screenshot of your appâ€”perhaps on a laptop or phone.

Use slow fade-in animations for the tagline and CTA to boost interactivity.

2. Feature Tiles
Turn descriptive text into iconâ€‘driven feature boxes (use neon-green icons).

Include a scrolling or video preview of your dashboard or key pages.

Frame in device mockups (MacBook, mobile) and add an entrance animation.

Add 2â€“3 quotes from users (real or placeholder) with avatar images.

Light Neonâ€‘green borders or glows around each testimonial card.

5. Pricing or Plans (even if demo)
Design toggleable monthly/yearly plans using neon green highlights.

Highlight the most popular plan with a glowing border or shadow.

6. FAQ Section
Use an accordion layout that expands with smooth motion.

Keep text in light gray (#CCCCCC) on black for readability.

7. Footer & Contact
Include logos and links: GitHub, LinkedIn, contact email.

Add a newsletter form styled with neon borders/buttons.
